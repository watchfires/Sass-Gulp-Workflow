# Sass Workflow and Dev Server with Gulp

This is a complete Sass workflow and dev server environment made with [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com), the [gulp-sass plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sass), and [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io).  It includes a very simple site made with HTML and Sass.  It was adapted from a Traversy Media YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/rmXVmfx3rNo).

## Installation

First, from within the project directory, install the dependencies.

```
$ npm install
```

Next, run the workflow, which will watch Sass files, compile them, and run them on the dev server (with live updates) at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

```
$ npm start
```
